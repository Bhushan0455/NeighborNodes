🏡 NeighborNodes — Community Borrowing Platform

NeighborNodes is a location-based web platform that enables people living in the same neighborhood to borrow and lend rarely-used household items such as ladders, projectors, camping gear, or power tools.
The goal is to promote sustainable consumption, reduce unnecessary purchases, and strengthen local community trust using modern web technologies.

🚀 Problem Statement

Many expensive household items are used only occasionally, yet individuals purchase them separately, leading to financial waste and environmental impact. Existing social platforms (e.g., messaging groups) lack structured systems for availability tracking, trust scoring, and secure borrowing workflows.

NeighborNodes solves this by providing:

Verified neighborhood-based access

Structured borrowing lifecycle

Trust and accountability system

Real-time request notifications
